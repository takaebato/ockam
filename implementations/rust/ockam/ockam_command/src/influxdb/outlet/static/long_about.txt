Create an InfluxDB Outlet that runs adjacent to an InfluxDB server. The Outlet unwraps Ockam messages and delivers the http request to the server, after attaching authentication information to it.

You must specify the TCP address of the server, that your Outlet should send raw TCP traffic to. You can also name your Outlet by giving it an alias.

When you create an InfluxDB Outlet, on an Ockam node, running on your local machine, it makes the InfluxDB server available from a worker address, to the corresponding InfluxDB Inlet (see `ockam influxfb-inlet`).
