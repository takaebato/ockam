An InfluxDB Inlet is a way of defining where a node should be listening for connections, and where it should forward that traffic to. It is one end (influxdb-outlet being the other) of a portal, which receives Http data, attach an authorization token header to it, chunks and wraps it into Ockam Routing messages and sends them along the supplied route.
